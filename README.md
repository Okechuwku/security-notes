🔐 Security & Penetration Testing Notes

This repository contains structured security notes, practical observations, and hands-on findings gathered during my learning and experience in penetration testing and web application security.

The notes are primarily based on:

1. Real world style security labs (e.g. PortSwigger Web Security Academy)

2. Hands on testing using tools such as Burp Suite

3. Independent research and experimentation

4. Capture The Flag (CTF) style challenges

5. Practical exploitation and defense concepts

   📌 Purpose of This Repository

The goal of this repository is to:

> Document what I learn in a clear and reusable format

> Reinforce concepts through written explanations and examples

> Build a personal security knowledge base

> Demonstrate consistent learning and practical understanding of cybersecurity concepts

> This repository is intended for educational and professional development purposes only.



Some of the areas documented here include:

1. Web application vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)

2. Insecure deserialization

3. Authentication & authorization flaws

4. WebSockets & API security

5. Client-side vs server-side security issues

6. Exploitation techniques and attack flows

7. Mitigation strategies and secure coding practices

⚠️ The repository is continuously updated as I learn new concepts and encounter new vulnerabilities.
